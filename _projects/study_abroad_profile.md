title: Study Abroad Profile – Bali, Indonesia
---

In Summer 2022, I studied abroad in **Bali, Indonesia** through Georgia State University’s *Bali Adventure: Culture & Sustainability* program. This experience blended cultural immersion with sustainability education and personal reflection. The program was grounded in experiential learning—every day brought new opportunities to engage with local communities, learn traditional practices, and deepen my understanding of sustainable development in a global context.

The course met key graduation requirements while providing access to deep cultural experiences: from herbal walks and temple visits to homestays, cooking classes, NGO site visits, and community ceremonies. What began as a spontaneous late-night decision to browse the study abroad site became one of the most transformative academic experiences of my undergraduate career.

Throughout the trip, I reflected on concepts like dignity, cultural preservation, local expertise, and ethical sustainability—ideas that now influence my academic focus in computing education and human-centered research.

**Cultural Engagement.** The program was rich with immersive workshops—Gamelan music, traditional Balinese dance, and community-led sustainability education. Our instructors frequently reinforced that “Time is relationship,” which resonated deeply with my personal and academic values.

**Sustainability in Action.** We visited organizations like Kopernik and Five Pillar Foundation, learning firsthand how Balinese communities implement sustainable solutions—from reusable period products to food waste processing and eco-tourism.

**Creative Expression.** From designing offerings for Saraswati Day to performing traditional dances, I was able to express myself and connect through ritual and rhythm. These experiences grounded me emotionally and intellectually.

**Reflections on Place & Privilege.** I spent a lot of time thinking about who gets access to spaces of global learning, who gets to feel safe while traveling, and what “adventure” means depending on your background. As a Black woman in tech, I found it powerful to be surrounded by intentional conversations about care, cultural context, and responsible travel.

**Key Takeaways.**
- Experiential learning expands how I define knowledge, especially outside of formal STEM environments.
- Design, ethics, and culture are inseparable—this trip showed me what it means to integrate them.
- My ongoing work in human-computer interaction and computing education is deeply influenced by moments like these.

This program was more than a class—it was a challenge, a joy, and a deep breath. I will always carry Bali with me in my research and in the way I move through the world.
